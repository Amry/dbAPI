# dbAPI
Simple db api with nodejs for my other application to add and retrive data from database. 

I am planning to use it for one of my mobile, and web application to

add new cities to db, 
retrieve all cities, 
delete particular city, 
retrive particular city, 
delete all cities,

More is coming ...
